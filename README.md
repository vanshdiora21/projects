# Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Projects Repository**!  
This repo contains a collection of different projects I've worked on, ranging from algorithmic trading simulations and financial models to recommendation systems and front-end prototypes.  

Each project is in its own folder and is self-contained with source code, documentation, and dependencies.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Factor Modelling
- Implemented a **factor model** for financial data.
- Identifies systematic factors that explain stock returns.
- Useful for portfolio analysis & risk management.

---

### 2. Market Making Simulation
- A **market-making trading simulator**.
- Implements bid-ask strategies to replicate how market makers provide liquidity.
- Helps understand spreads, inventory risk, and profit/loss dynamics.

---

### 3. Movie Recommendation System
- A basic recommender system.
- Built initial **front-end structure**.
- Suggests movies to users based on similarity metrics or collaborative filtering.

---

### 4. Options Pricing
- Models for valuing **financial options** (e.g., Black-Scholes, Binomial Trees).
- Analyzes how underlying asset volatility, time, and interest impacts derivative pricing.

---

### 5. Pairs Trading Strategy
- Implementation of a **statistical arbitrage strategy**.
- Identifies pairs of correlated stocks and executes mean-reversion trades.
- Includes signal generation and backtesting procedures.

---

### 6. Stock Trading with Machine Learning
- ML-powered trading framework.
- Uses financial data to train predictive models for trading strategies.
- Currently in development with files uploaded recently.

---

### 7. Volatility Forecasting Model
- Forecasts financial market volatility using statistical/ML techniques.
- Built an interactive **Streamlit app** for visualization.
- Helps analyze risks and market uncertainty.
