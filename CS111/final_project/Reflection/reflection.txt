The source bodies of texts used were episodes from the famous shows ‘friends’ and ‘How I met your mother’. Other source bodies used were two texts written by Shakespeare - Macbeth and Julius Caesar compared against a JW rowling work - harry potter and the sorcerer's stone. Another source used was Times of India articles compared against NDTV articles. Both sources are famous Indian TV news shows. Lastly, the last body used were my WR112 essays compared against a sample comparative essay. 
The results of the comparison showed that the Friends episodes were more similar than Friends and How I met your mother. I also came to know that the Shakespeare works are more similar to each other than the JW rowling work. I also came to know that the two Times of INdia articles are similar to each other than the NDTV article and finally my WR112 essays were closer to each other than the sample essay. 
The text classification program works well in order to get a rough idea, but there can be several improvements. For example in the current functions, more stems could be put, more ways to compare could also be put. For example, there could be more ways in order to compare texts such as number of sentences, connotations etc.
