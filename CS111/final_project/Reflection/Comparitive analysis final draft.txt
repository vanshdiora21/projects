M[a]ultilinguistic vs multilocal[b]
In her [c]Ted talk, “Don't ask where I'm from, ask where I'm a local”, Taiye Selasi sheds light on the topic of whether a country can be the basis for understanding the background of a human. She emphasizes that people are shaped by the rituals, relationships and restrictions rather than simply the country they are from.  Her point of view dictates that people are from localities rather than countries. On the other hand, coinciding with this point, Lera Boroditsky in her Ted talk, ““How language shapes the way we think'' implies that language plays a vital role when it comes to the thought process of a person. She believes that a person thinks according to what a language enables that person to do. Simple characteristics such as direction, counting and colors change from person to person simply because of how language affects a person. 


However, it is worth questioning whether there is any correlation between the language and the [d]locality of a person when it comes to the effect on cognitive ability. To what extent do locality, physical location and language affect a person's experience? And furthermore, a person is known to be local simply because he/she can speak, think and have similar cognitive abilities to the people in that region or is a person considered to be local because of the experience and relation to the place and people? These questions are important to ask as one can reflect on the way they have been thinking all their life and whether it is on the basis of language or locality restrictions. Personally for me, being multilingual, being in a different country, and having the ability to communicate with people in 5 languages, I consider myself a local in various places. Reflecting back, I know that this has made a huge impact on my thinking process and my ability to process information the way I do.


Firstly, what role do languages play in making someone local? Lera Boroditskly repeatedly emphasizes the fact that we humans have the “ability to speak through languages”. (Boroditsky)I[e]n addition to that, she sheds light on the concept that the ability to speak in a language dictates the way we think and affects the way we perform tasks on a daily basis, right from looking at colors to counting numbers. For example, Boroditsky states that Russians are better at differentiating between light blue and dark blue, simply because in the Russian language, there is no word for blue, rather just a word for light blue and one for dark blue. (Boroditsky)F[f]urthermore, she also differentiates between languages such as Spanish and German, due to the difference in the gender in certain objects such as a bridge.(Boroditsky) Not only the gender, but the way the bridge is described also changes because of the gender difference. Boroditsky repeatedly emphasizes on how languages play a vital role in dictating the way people think.  Selasi, on the other hand, states that a person cannot be categorized by the country they are from or the general language they speak; rather she dictates that a person is local by the experiences they have. She states that a place can be said to be diverse, with people with different backgrounds and different languages, yet be similar due to similarities in professions of parents.Often, the fact that they have the same maleiu is ignored.  Selasi believes that these similarities in people speaks to humanities, not just countries, as countries are not a stationary point in time, rather always changing. Furthermore, she states that culture exists in communities and communities in content. This is important to note because it takes into account the factor of culture in locality. 


Secondly, is a person local by experiences or by similar cognitive abilities? Borodistky, though not directly, implies that a person can be said to be belonging to a group if they have similar cognitive abilities. (Boroditsky)To elaborate, a member of the Kuuk Thaayorre, an aboriginal community in Australia, can be said to be local of that place even if he/she does not have much experience there.(Boroditsky)  Simply because of the fact that they have the cognitive ability similar to other members.(Boroditsky) The Kuuk Thaayorre only talk in terms of cardinal directions such as north, west, south and east.(Boroditsky) However, something unique that Lera Boroditsky showcases is the ability for them to perceive time in a constant and unique way from west to east as opposed to other general languages such as English where it is always from left to right. This unique ability that differentiates them from others would also make them a part of that locality. Moreover, Taiye Selasi agrees to this point to some extent. She states that a person can be local simply because of the experiences that the person has, not only because of cognitive abilities (Selasi). She explores a new topic of “3 Rs” to be local rather than just language(Selasi). To elaborate, she states that a person is local to a particular area if they follow their rituals and day to day activities are similar to those in the culture, if their relationship with people and the place gives them a sense of belonging and experience and lastly whether they have a lot of imposed restrictions on where they live such as passport, community biases, et cetera(Selasi). According to Selasi, a member of the Kuuk Thaayorre, anywhere in the world, would be called a local of the region, and a multi local of different places, and not just be restricted to the country they are from.(Selasi) 


Lastly, why does locality matter in terms of research for science? Boroditsky raises a huge concern of most research taking place by American researchers in the English language. However, the English language also has restrictions that are not accounted for such as gender and restrictions in qualities such as better orientation that can take place in better languages. However when studying if locality matters in terms of research, looking at Selasi’s perspective, a person who is multilocal would have a higher chance of having different perspectives than people who are from one locality. However, it cannot be defined that locality plays an equal role as language. 


To conclude, Lera Boroditsky and Taiye Selasi highlight a lot of effects on humans such as language and locality. They both present different features but explain how different languages and culture can improve a person's cognitive ability.

[a]Great job here Vansh! The content was very logical, thoughtful and organized. You made some very good points regarding how these text can be compared.  The source of the lost points had to do with MLA formatting. So this is really important - that's why it counts so much in this class. It's a very good way to let your professors know from the beginning that you are in control of academic English. Overall, stellar job!


Grade: 90


See the rubric below to find out how this grade was calculated.
[b]Good title! Because you want to strike a formal tone, you need to spell out "vs." so that it's "versus." 


You also need some elements above the title, such as your name, my name, the course, date, etc. Refer to the MLA SAMPLE PAPER PDF  file I uploaded to your folder to see what I mean.
[c]you need to indent your paragraphs for MLA style
[d]You need the same line spaces between paragraphs as you do between lines.
[e]you need a time stamp here, minutes and seconds, for when she says this in her talk. You need a period and a space before the next sentence right?
[f]period goes after the citation, not after the end of the sentence. So the citation is part of the sentence.
[g]no italics here; other than that, a perfect Works Cited page!
