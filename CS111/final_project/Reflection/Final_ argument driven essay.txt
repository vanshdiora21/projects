To what extent can languages affect a person?
There is a lot of debate on the extent to which language can affect a human's cognitive ability. When reflecting on the effect of languages, one can look into depth of how languages can affect a person's cognitive abilities, visual process and creative thinking abilities. Lera Boroditsky, a professor at the University of California, San Diego and a cognitive scientist elaborates on “how languages shape the way we think”. In her talk, she sheds light on the effect of language on everyday life of an average person. today over 7000 languages are spoken in the world, each gives a person new insights on who they are, what their personality traits are, what their perspectives are and how they think. [b]Furthermore, languages inevitably have an in depth role in the cognitive abilities of a human being [c]however it is worth questioning whether knowing a language can affect one's perception of global and discrete variables such as time and space. And if it does affect one's perception of such factors, to what extent and how? Can something as solid as the perception of time that can be standardized universally be affected by the way languages are spoken? This also extends to question the difference between definitive knowledge and indefinite knowledge. [d]
Person[e]ally, being multilingual, I have the ability to have internal thought processes in my head in multiple languages. This also reflects upon the Sapir Whorf hypothesis that states that languages have an effect on our world view and our thinking process. (Go[f]ldman) Even the structure of language can impact the way we think, for example Keith Chen, another Ted talk guest author found that speaking in English can stop a person from thinking in the future because of the clear differences between the tenses whereas Spanish has different effects. [g](Author) Ler[h]a Boroditsky also touches upon this topic by stating that “to have a second language is to have a second soul”. 
Furthermore, an example of languages affect t[i]he cognitive abilities of a human bei[j]ng as people with different language adaptations can imagine scenarios in different aspec[k]ts. Boroditsky gives an example of the one bridge that can be described as different perspectives just because of the difference in the gender it is assigned to in different languages such as German and Spanish. 
It is established that languages can make a huge impact on the way human beings can perceive different scenarios, [l]however to what extent can languages affect defined and discrete abilities such as time, space and direction? 
In order to look at the effect of language on the sense of direction, Boroditsky looks at the Aborginal community in Australia - the Kuuk Thaayorre people. The interesting take about their language was the use of cardinal directions such as “north, south east and west” rather than using “left and right”. In fact, not only to explain directions but also to greet someone, the Kuuk Thaayorre used directions. These advanced uses of directional ability can give a sense of different perspective of directions, a somewhat better skill set of orienting themselves. 
However, though the sense of orientation can be better, the difference in perception of the directions can be questioned. Direction can be said to be discrete and concrete data with factual evidence in order to orient oneself. 
Moreover, something as concrete as time as well can be argued to not be affected by time simply because of how concrete the concept of time is. It is quantise[m]d in a way that every second is a quantity that can be measured and used globally. However, a recent study proved that language can have an effect on how we perceive time. [n]For example, English and s[o]wedish people tend to mark time by referring to physical distances such as short and long, whereas Greek and Spanish speakers tend to speak about time through physical quantities. (Lancaster University)
In order to conclude, though it is debatable whether learning different languages can affect the way one perceives a human being’s cognitive abilities, and direction of space, direction and time, there are several studies including Boroditsky’s that state that the multiple languages can have several effects on the subconscious mind due to the different perspectives that open up.
